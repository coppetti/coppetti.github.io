When a project belongs to a Stakeholder compose by many parts (i.e. CIO, Administration, HR, ...), sometimes the Product Owner (or even the Scrum Master) struggle to make everyone happy with the delivery plan. While each of the parts does not agree with the critical features defined for each sprint, Product Owners should be able to find a way that satisfies all stakeholders.

The use of Parking Lot does not apply as the ideal solution since it does not have the proper semantic in the way it appears. Thus, using a Wishlist, at the same time that allows scrum team to focus on critical features, it gives stakeholders an idea that their amazing/urgent/super feature is on the way.

Using a Scrum board or a Kanban (for teams using Lean or Scrumban), we can define a lane to populate with items that are not critical, or planned in this sprint, working on them at the right time and make your stakeholders happy.

As you can see in the figure above, the use of a wishlist is very simple and can be added to every existent kanban/scrum board.
It is a good way to deal with stakeholder's requests at the same time it keeps the team focus on the sprint planning and critical features.
